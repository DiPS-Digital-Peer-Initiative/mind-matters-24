						<p>To commemorate the World Mental Health Day in October, the Young Peer Educators of Delhi Public School Bangalore South has once again decided to organise the Mind Matters Conclave 2024. The theme for the 2024 World Mental Health Day is “My Health, My Right” and this year our main objective for the conclave is to generate awareness on the importance of mental health and wellbeing .The proposed event aligns perfectly with our school's vision and commitment to holistic development. The primary goal for the event is to nurture Leadership Skills and qualities among the youth in institutions and schools. This event will help the youth to share, enhance and empower each other through best practices of Mental Health and Life Skills employed in their respective institutions. The knowledge and awareness they gain from this conclave can have a long-lasting impact. The strategies and information acquired will undoubtedly assist in the maintenance of good mental health throughout the academic and personal journey of students.</p>
						<p>The Peer Educators recognised the importance of mental health awareness and support within the school community and they have created this platform to address and exchange information with peers from other schools and institutes on various mental health challenges faced by the youth and finding innovative ways to overcome the problems.</p>
