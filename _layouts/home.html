						<p>With great pleasure, we welcome you back to our Young Adolescent Peer Educators Leadership Conclave - “MIND MATTERS 2025". As part of World Mental Health Day, we propose creating awareness on the theme "Access to services – mental health in catastrophes and emergencies" through various thought-provoking discussions, interactive workshops, collaborations with mental health institutes and organisations, stall exhibitions, inter-school competitions, and more. This year, as we organise the Mind Matters Conclave on the 10th and 11th of October, we invite you all once again for wholehearted participation on both days.</p>
						<p>We are thrilled to introduce an exciting new addition to this year’s “Mind Matters 2025”, that is the psychology event <em>Mind in Motion</em>. This event is curated and led by passionate Senior Secondary students of the Psychology Department. This immersive experience invites participants to explore the captivating world of the human mind through interactive games and stimulating challenges. It aims to promote mental health awareness, spark curiosity, and make learning about human behaviour fun and engaging. Your participation and contribution are vital to the success of this Regional Conclave. We will truly be excited to see the impactful ideas and solutions that will emerge from our time together. The proposed event aligns perfectly with our school's vision and commitment to holistic development. The primary goal for the event is to nurture leadership skills and qualities among the youth in institutions and schools. This event will help the youth to share and empower each other through best practices of mental health and life skills employed in their respective institutions.</p>

						<p>The Peer Educators recognised the importance of mental health awareness and support within the school community, and they have created this platform to address and exchange information with peers from other schools and institutes on various mental health challenges faced by the youth and finding innovative ways to overcome the problems.</p>
						<p>The Central Board of Secondary Education(CBSE) has initiated and supported the Adolescent Peer Educators Leadership Program in collaboration with Expressions India for enriching the life skills, holistic health, and well-being of students in our country. This program was launched in the year 2021, and Delhi Public School Bangalore South was one of the first few schools to have been a part of this program. From 2021, we have successfully conducted various mental health awareness programs for our students and the community.</p>
