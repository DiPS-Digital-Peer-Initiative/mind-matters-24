# Mind Matters 2024 -- A Retrospective

The Young Adolescent Peer Educator’s Leadership Conclave - Mind Matters 2024 saw its inception in the year 2023 under the able guidance of the Master Peer Educators and Peer Educators of Delhi Public School, Bangalore South. The event was organised on 27th and 28th October to celebrate World Mental Health Day. The Conclave was a significant event as it saw active participation from students all across the state aiming to promote mental health awareness and education among one another. The inception of the Regional Summit came to our attention when we participated in the National Peer Educator’s Leadership Summit in New Delhi organised by CBSE Board in collaboration with Expressions India. The two-day event featured a series of mental health awareness workshops for parents, teachers, and students, panel discussions with experts sharing the views on mental health awareness trainings and support systems provided in the schools for the holistic growth of young minds. We also had a number of competitions like Nukkad Natak, Yuva Sansad, Natyalaya, and JAM  were organised to inspire students to think critically about mental wellness and to express their thoughts in innovative ways. In 2024 we introduced a new competition “Reel making” where the students crafted a 30 to 60 second reel centered on mental health topic emphasising on positivity The participants showcased impressive creativity, with many entries reflecting deep empathy and understanding of mental health issues.

Winners of these competitions were awarded certificates and prizes, recognising their efforts and contributions to raising awareness.

The fashion show we organised was specifically showcasing the different challanges faced by the youth in todays world and how we can learn to overcome them.

The combination of competition, celebration, and live music made the Mind Matters Conclave a memorable event, reinforcing the importance of mental health in an engaging and uplifting manner.
