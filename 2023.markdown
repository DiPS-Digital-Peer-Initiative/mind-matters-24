# Mind Matters 2023 -- A Retrospective

The Young Adolescent Peer Educator’s Leadership Conclave - Mind Matters 2023 saw its inception in the year 2023 under the able guidance of the Master Peer Educators and Peer Educators of Delhi Public School, Bangalore South. The event was organised on 7th and 8th October to celebrate World Mental Health Day on 8th October 2023. The Conclave was a significant event as it saw active participation from students all across the state, aiming to promote mental health awareness and education among one another. 

The inception of the Regional Summit came to our attention when we participated in the National Peer Educator’s Leadership Summit in New Delhi, organised by the CBSE Board in collaboration with Expressions India. The two-day event featured a series of mental health awareness workshops for parents, teachers, and students, and panel discussions with experts sharing their views on mental health awareness trainings and support systems provided in schools for the holistic growth of young minds. We also had a number of competitions like Nukkad Natak, Yuva Sansad, Natyalaya, and JAM, which  were organised to inspire students to think critically about mental wellness and to express their thoughts in innovative ways. The participants showcased impressive creativity, with many entries reflecting deep empathy and understanding of mental health issues. 

Winners of these competitions were awarded certificates and prizes, recognising their efforts and contributions to raising awareness. The grand finale was a highlight of the conclave, marked by the much-anticipated prize distribution ceremony and the powerhouse live musical performance of Ms. Sinchan Dixit. The atmosphere was filled with excitement as live performances took centre stage, offering a blend of music that resonated with the theme of mental wellness. The musical evening not only entertained but also provided a platform for students and guests to unwind and connect in a relaxed environment.

The combination of competition, celebration, and live music made the Mind Matters Conclave a memorable event, reinforcing the importance of mental health in an engaging and uplifting manner.
